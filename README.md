# graphite-ui package

Graphite is a solid and minimal UI for atom. It has a flat design with dark cool gray colors.

Shown below with the [file-icons](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) and the [minimap](https://github.com/fundon/atom-minimap) packages and using the [behave](https://github.com/carlo/behave-theme) syntax-theme.
