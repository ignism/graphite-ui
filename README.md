# graphite-ui package

Graphite is a solid and minimal UI for atom. It has a flat design with dark cool gray colors.

Shown below with the [file-icons](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) and the [minimap](https://github.com/fundon/atom-minimap) packages and using the [behave](https://github.com/carlo/behave-theme) syntax-theme.

### Note
I removed the option for syntax coloring. I thought it was better to make a specific theme for it. If you want to check it out, look up [polymorph-ui](https://github.com/ignism/polymorph-ui)
